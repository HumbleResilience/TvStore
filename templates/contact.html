    <h2>So Lorem Ipsum is bad (not necessarily)

        There's lot of hate out there for a text that amounts to little more than garbled words in an old
        language. The
        villagers are out there with a vengeance to get that Frankenstein, wielding torches and pitchforks,
        wanting to tar and
        feather it at the least, running it out of town in shame.

        One of the villagers, Kristina Halvorson from Adaptive Path, holds steadfastly to the notion that design
        can’t be tested
        without real content:

        I’ve heard the argument that “lorem ipsum” is effective in wireframing or design because it helps people
        focus on the
        actual layout, or color scheme, or whatever. What kills me here is that we’re talking about creating a
        user experience
        that will (whether we like it or not) be DRIVEN by words. The entire structure of the page or app flow
        is FOR THE WORDS.
        If that's what you think how bout the other way around? How can you evaluate content without design? No
        typography, no
        colors, no layout, no styles, all those things that convey the important signals that go beyond the mere
        textual,
        hierarchies of information, weight, emphasis, oblique stresses, priorities, all those subtle cues that
        also have visual
        and emotional appeal to the reader. Rigid proponents of content strategy may shun the use of dummy copy
        but then
        designers might want to ask them to provide style sheets with the copy decks they supply that are in
        tune with the
        design direction they require.

        Or else, an alternative route: set checkpoints, networks, processes, junctions between content and
        layout. Depending on
        the state of affairs it may be fine to concentrate either on design or content, reversing gears when
        needed.

        Or maybe not. How about this: build in appropriate intersections and checkpoints between design and
        content. Accept that
        it’s sometimes okay to focus just on the content or just on the design.

        Luke Wroblewski, currently a Product Director at Google, holds that fake data can break down in real
        life:

        Using dummy content or fake information in the Web design process can result in products with
        unrealistic assumptions
        and potentially serious design flaws. A seemingly elegant design can quickly begin to bloat with
        unexpected content or
        break under the weight of actual activity. Fake data can ensure a nice looking layout but it doesn’t
        reflect what a
        living, breathing application must endure. Real data does.
        Websites in professional use templating systems. Commercial publishing platforms and content management
        systems ensure
        that you can show different text, different data using the same template. When it's about controlling
        hundreds of
        articles, product pages for web shops, or user profiles in social networks, all of them potentially with
        different
        sizes, formats, rules for differing elements things can break, designs agreed upon can have unintended
        consequences and
        look much different than expected.

        This is quite a problem to solve, but just doing without greeking text won't fix it. Using test items of
        real content
        and data in designs will help, but there's no guarantee that every oddity will be found and corrected.
        Do you want to be
        sure? Then a prototype or beta site with real content published from the real CMS is needed—but you’re
        not going that
        far until you go through an initial design cycle.

        Lorem Ipsum actually is usefull in the design stage as it focuses our attention on places where the
        content is a dynamic
        block coming from the CMS (unlike static content elements that will always stay the same.) Blocks of
        Lorem Ipsum with a
        character count range provide a obvious reminder to check and re-check that the design and the content
        model match up.

        Kyle Fiedler from the Design Informer feels that distracting copy is your fault:

        If the copy becomes distracting in the design then you are doing something wrong or they are discussing
        copy changes. It
        might be a bit annoying but you could tell them that that discussion would be best suited for another
        time. At worst the
        discussion is at least working towards the final goal of your site where questions about lorem ipsum
        don’t.</h2>
