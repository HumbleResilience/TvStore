    <h2>So Lorem Ipsum is bad (not necessarily)

        There's lot of hate out there for a text that amounts to little more than garbled words in an old
        language. The
        villagers are out there with a vengeance to get that Frankenstein, wielding torches and pitchforks,
        wanting to tar and
        feather it at the least, running it out of town in shame.

        One of the villagers, Kristina Halvorson from Adaptive Path, holds steadfastly to the notion that design
        can’t be tested
        without real content:

        I’ve heard the argument that “lorem ipsum” is effective in wireframing or design because it helps people
        focus on the
        actual layout, or color scheme, or whatever. What kills me here is that we’re talking about creating a
        user experience
        that will (whether we like it or not) be DRIVEN by words. The entire structure of the page or app flow
        is FOR THE WORDS.
        If that's what you think how bout the other way around? How can you evaluate content without design? No
        typography, no
        colors, no layout, no styles, all those things that convey the important signals that go beyond the mere
        textual,
        hierarchies of information, weight, emphasis, oblique stresses, priorities, all those subtle cues that
        also have visual
        and emotional appeal to the reader. Rigid proponents of content strategy may shun the use of dummy copy
        but then
        designers might want to ask them to provide style sheets with the copy decks they supply that are in
        tune with the
        design direction they require.
